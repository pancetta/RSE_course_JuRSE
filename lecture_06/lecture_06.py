#
# ## Overview
# This lecture teaches you how to automate testing and ensure code quality through
# Continuous Integration (CI). We'll continue our temperature conversion story,
# setting up automated testing that would have prevented the research disaster
# from Lecture 5.
#
# **Duration**: ~90 minutes
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# Before starting this lecture, you should be familiar with:
# - Writing and running pytest tests (covered in Lecture 5)
# - Git and GitHub basics (covered in Lectures 1-2)
# - Python project structure and virtual environments (covered in Lecture 4)
# - Basic YAML syntax (we'll explain as we go)
# - AI-assisted coding basics, including reviewing AI suggestions like a diff (covered in
#   Lecture 3)
#
# This lecture directly builds on Lecture 5's testing concepts and requires a GitHub account.
#
# ## Learning Objectives
# - Understand what Continuous Integration (CI) is and why it matters
# - Set up automated testing with GitHub Actions
# - Configure CI workflows for GitLab
# - Build reproducible research pipelines
# - Automate code quality checks
# - Prevent bugs from reaching production/publication
# - Use AI assistants to draft CI workflows productively, while still verifying they run what
#   they claim to run

# ## Part 1: The Missing Piece - Automation
#
# ### Recap: The Temperature Conversion Disaster
#
# In Lecture 5, we learned about the climate research team that published incorrect results
# due to a bug in their temperature conversion code. We wrote tests to catch such bugs.
#
# But there's still a problem: **tests only help if you actually run them!**
#
# This seems obvious, but it's the Achilles' heel of testing. You can have a perfect test suite
# with 100% coverage, but if someone forgets to run the tests before committing code, bugs still
# slip through. Manual processes fail eventually—someone gets busy, forgets, or assumes their
# small change "couldn't possibly break anything."
#
# ### The Human Factor
#
# Even with a comprehensive test suite, bugs can slip through when testing isn't automated:
#
# - **Developer forgets to run tests before committing**: Happens more often than you'd think
# - **Tests run on one person's machine but not others**: "Works on my machine" syndrome
# - **New team member doesn't know tests exist**: No documentation or onboarding
# - **Tests pass on your computer but fail on colleague's setup**: Environment differences
# - **Someone commits code late at night without testing**: Tired developer, honest mistake
# - **Tests exist but aren't part of the workflow**: No one remembers to run them regularly
#
# **The fundamental problem**: Relying on humans to remember manual steps doesn't scale. We're
# forgetful, we get busy, we take shortcuts. The solution is to remove humans from the loop—
# automate testing so it happens every time, without exception.
#
# ### Enter: Continuous Integration
#
# **Continuous Integration (CI)** automates testing every time code changes. It's a practice where
# developers integrate their work frequently (daily or more), and each integration is verified by
# an automated build and test process. This catches problems early, when they're easiest to fix.
#
# **How it works:**
# 1. Developer pushes code to repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
# 2. CI system automatically detects the change—no human intervention needed
# 3. CI system runs all tests in a clean, reproducible environment
# 4. Results are reported back (pass/fail) within minutes
# 5. Bugs are caught before they can cause harm or reach other developers
#
# **Benefits:**
# - **Catch bugs early**: Before they reach main branch and affect others
# - **Consistent environment**: Same for everyone—no more "works on my machine"
# - **No excuses**: Tests always run—can't forget or skip them
# - **Confidence**: Know code works before merging—sleep better at night
# - **Documentation**: CI config shows exactly how to run tests—reproducible by anyone
# - **Faster feedback**: Know within minutes if your change broke something
#
# **Research context**: For research software, CI is crucial for reproducibility. Your CI configuration
# documents exactly how to build and test your code, making it easy for reviewers and other researchers
# to verify your results. Many journals now require CI badges showing tests pass.

# ## Part 2: Introduction to GitHub Actions
#
# ### A Note on AI and CI Configuration
#
# Writing CI workflow files is exactly the kind of task AI assistants are good at—the YAML
# syntax is well-documented, the patterns are standard, and there's a huge amount of example
# workflow code to draw on. Asking an AI assistant to draft a starting workflow, or to add a
# step for a new Python version or operating system, is a reasonable way to save time on the
# boilerplate ahead. The usual habits from Lecture 3 still apply, though: read the generated
# workflow like a diff rather than trusting it blindly, and run it for real before assuming it
# does what it claims—a CI config is still just code, and "looks right" isn't the same as "is
# right."
#
# ### What is GitHub Actions?
#
# **GitHub Actions** is GitHub's built-in CI/CD platform. Unlike earlier CI systems that required
# separate services (like Travis CI or CircleCI), GitHub Actions is integrated directly into GitHub,
# making it incredibly convenient.
#
# **GitHub Actions** is:
# - **Free for public repositories**: Unlimited minutes for open-source projects
# - **Free for private repos (with limits)**: 2000 minutes/month on free tier
# - **Integrated directly into GitHub**: No third-party accounts needed
# - **Uses simple YAML configuration**: Human-readable, version-controlled with your code
# - **Supports multiple operating systems**: Linux, Windows, macOS—test on all platforms
# - **Has a huge marketplace of pre-built actions**: Don't reinvent the wheel
#
# **When to use GitHub Actions vs. other CI systems**: For most projects hosted on GitHub, GitHub
# Actions is the easiest choice. Use alternatives like GitLab CI if you're on GitLab, Jenkins for
# self-hosted enterprise systems, or CircleCI/Travis if you need features GitHub Actions doesn't
# provide yet.
#
# ### Key Concepts
#
# Understanding these terms helps you read and write GitHub Actions workflows:
#
# - **Workflow**: An automated process (e.g., "run tests")—the whole CI pipeline
# - **Job**: Set of steps that run together on the same machine—can run multiple jobs in parallel
# - **Step**: Individual task (e.g., "install Python")—the smallest unit of work
# - **Action**: Reusable unit of code—like a function you can call in your workflow
# - **Runner**: Virtual machine that executes jobs—GitHub provides these, or you can host your own
# - **Trigger**: Event that starts workflow (e.g., push, pull request)—defines when CI runs
#
# **Mental model**: Think of a workflow as a script, jobs as functions in that script (that can run
# in parallel), and steps as individual commands. Triggers are like "when should this script run?"
# and runners are the computers that execute it.

# ## Part 3: Creating Your First GitHub Actions Workflow
#
# ### Workflow File Structure
#
# GitHub Actions workflows are defined in YAML files stored in `.github/workflows/`.
#
# **Directory structure:**
# ```
# my_project/
# ├── .github/
# │   └── workflows/
# │       └── tests.yml       # CI workflow
# ├── src/
# │   └── temperature.py
# ├── tests/
# │   └── test_temperature.py
# └── README.md
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Basic Workflow Example
#
# Let's create a workflow that runs our temperature conversion tests:

# %%
# This represents: .github/workflows/tests.yml

basic_workflow = """
name: Test Suite

# When to run this workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# What to do
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Step 2: Set up Python

# %% [markdown]
# ### Understanding the Workflow
#
# Let's break down each part of the workflow to understand what it does and why:
#
# **Triggers (`on`):**
# - `push`: Run when code is pushed to main or develop branches—catches bugs in merged code
# - `pull_request`: Run when PR is opened/updated targeting main—prevents bugs from being merged
#
# **Jobs (`jobs`):**
# - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: Use Ubuntu Linux virtual machine—most common, fastest
# - Could also use `windows-latest` or `macos-latest`—useful for cross-platform testing
#
# **Steps:**
# - `uses`: Pre-built action from GitHub marketplace—tested, maintained code you can trust
# - `run`: Shell command to execute—anything you'd type in terminal
# - Each step runs in sequence—if one fails, the job fails
#
# **Why this prevents disasters:**
# - Tests run automatically on every push—no way to forget
# - Can't merge PR with failing tests—GitHub shows red X, reviewers see it
# - Same environment for all developers—no "works on my machine" excuses
# - Catches bugs before they reach main branch—main stays stable and deployable
#
# **Common pitfall**: Forgetting to make tests a required check before merging. In your repository
# settings, enable "Require status checks to pass before merging" to enforce that CI must pass.

#         <li><strong>Build a deployment pipeline:</strong> Add steps that build documentation with Sphinx, run performance
#         benchmarks, and deploy to GitHub Pages—automate your entire release process.</li>
#         <li><strong>Set up status badges:</strong> Add workflow status badges to your README that show build status, test
#         coverage, and documentation status—make quality visible at a glance.</li>

# ## Part 7: GitLab CI/CD
#
# ### Introduction to GitLab CI
#
# **GitLab CI** is GitLab's built-in CI/CD platform. It's similar to GitHub Actions but:
# - Uses `.gitlab-ci.yml` instead of `.github/workflows/*.yml`
# - Different syntax and structure
# - Can be self-hosted (important for sensitive research data)
# - Free for public and private repositories
#
# ### Why Learn Both?
#
# - Many universities host GitLab internally
# - Some research institutions require on-premise hosting
# - Some projects use GitHub, others use GitLab
# - Concepts transfer between platforms

# %% [markdown]
# ### GitLab CI File Structure
#
# GitLab CI workflows are defined in a single `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the repository root.
#
# **Directory structure:**
# ```
# my_project/
# ├── .gitlab-ci.yml      # CI configuration
# ├── src/
# │   └── temperature.py
# ├── tests/
# │   └── test_temperature.py
# └── README.md
# ```

# ### Basic GitLab CI Example

# ## Part 8: CI Best Practices for Research
#
# ### 1. Start Simple, Add Gradually
#
# **Phase 1: Basic testing**
# ```yaml
# - Run pytest on every push
# ```
#
# **Phase 2: Add quality checks**
# ```yaml
# - Add linting
# - Add coverage requirements
# ```
#
# **Phase 3: Multi-platform**
# ```yaml
# - Test on different OS
# - Test on different Python versions
# ```
#
# **Phase 4: Advanced**
# ```yaml
# - Test notebooks
# - Validate data
# - Check reproducibility
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### 2. Make Tests Fast
#
# Slow tests discourage running CI frequently.
#
# **Strategies:**
# - Use small test datasets
# - Mock expensive operations
# - Run heavy tests only on main branch
# - Use parallel execution
# - Cache dependencies
#
# **Example timing:**

# %%
test_timing_example = """
# Fast tests (run on every commit)
fast-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pytest tests/unit/ -v  # < 1 minute
  
# Slow tests (run only on main/PR)
integration-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pytest tests/integration/ -v  # 5-10 minutes
  only:
    - main
    - merge_requests

# Very slow tests (run nightly)
full-analysis:
  stage: test
  script:
    - bash scripts/run_full_analysis.sh  # 1+ hours
  only:
    - schedules
"""

print("Test Timing Strategy:")
print("=" * 70)
print(test_timing_example)

# %% [markdown]
# ### 3. Protect Important Branches
#
# **GitHub:**
# 1. Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
# 2. Require status checks to pass before merging
# 3. Require pull request reviews
# 4. Require branches to be up to date
#
# **GitLab:**
# 1. Settings → Repository → Protected branches
# 2. Allowed to merge: Maintainers
# 3. Require CI to pass
# 4. Require approval from code owners
#
# This ensures:
# ✅ No untested code reaches main
# ✅ All changes reviewed
# ✅ Tests pass before merge
# ✅ Main branch always in good state

# %% [markdown]
# ### 4. Use Status Badges
#
# Show CI status in your README:
#
# **GitHub Actions:**
# ```markdown
# ![Tests](https://github.com/username/repo/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)
# ```
#
# **GitLab CI:**
# ```markdown
# ![Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/username/repo/badges/main/pipeline.svg)
# ![Coverage](https://gitlab.com/username/repo/badges/main/coverage.svg)
# ```
#
# Benefits:
# - Immediate visibility of project health
# - Shows you care about quality
# - Builds trust in your research code

# %% [markdown]
# ### 5. Monitor and Maintain
#
# CI requires ongoing maintenance:
#
# - **Update dependencies**: Keep actions/images current
# - **Fix flaky tests**: Tests that randomly fail
# - **Optimize speed**: As test suite grows
# - **Review failures**: Don't ignore failing tests
# - **Update for new Python versions**: As they release

#     <p>Optimize your CI pipeline for speed and reliability—every second counts!</p>
#     <ul>
#         <li><strong>Measure and optimize runtime:</strong> Add timing to each workflow
#         step, identify the slowest parts, and optimize them—try caching dependencies,
#         running jobs in parallel, or using faster test selection strategies.</li>
#         <li><strong>Implement smart caching:</strong> Cache pip packages, pre-built
#         dependencies, and test databases across runs—reduce a 5-minute build to 30 seconds
#         by reusing previous work.</li>
#         <li><strong>Handle flaky tests:</strong> Identify tests that randomly fail, add
#         retries with proper delays, or refactor them to be deterministic—build a CI
#         pipeline you can trust 100% of the time.</li>

#
# **Without CI (Lecture 5 scenario):**
# 1. Developer writes buggy `fahrenheit_to_celsius`
# 2. Forgets to write/run tests
# 3. Commits and pushes code
# 4. Bug makes it to production
# 5. Incorrect results published
# 6. Paper retracted months later
#
# **With CI:**
# 1. Developer writes buggy `fahrenheit_to_celsius`
# 2. Pushes code to GitHub
# 3. CI automatically runs tests
# 4. Tests FAIL (bug detected!)
# 5. Pull request blocked from merging
# 6. Developer fixes bug before it causes harm
#
# **Result:** Crisis averted! ✅

# ## Part 10: Setting Up CI for Your Research Project
#
# ### Step-by-Step Guide
#
# **For GitHub:**
#
# 1. **Create workflow file:**
#    ```bash
#    mkdir -p .github/workflows
#    touch .github/workflows/tests.yml
#    ```
#
# 2. **Add basic workflow** (from examples above)
#
# 3. **Add test requirements** to `requirements.txt`
#
# 4. **Commit and push:**
#    ```bash
#    git add .github/workflows/tests.yml
#    git commit -m "Add CI workflow"
#    git push
#    ```
#
# 5. **Check workflow runs:**
#    - Go to GitHub → Actions tab
#    - See workflow running
#    - View results
#
# 6. **Enable branch protection:**
#    - Settings → Branches
#    - Add rule for `main`
#    - Require status checks
#
# **For GitLab:**
#
# 1. **Create CI file:**
#    ```bash
#    touch .gitlab-ci.yml
#    ```
#
# 2. **Add configuration** (from examples above)
#
# 3. **Commit and push:**
#    ```bash
#    git add .gitlab-ci.yml
#    git commit -m "Add GitLab CI"
#    git push
#    ```
#
# 4. **Check pipeline:**
#    - Go to CI/CD → Pipelines
#    - View pipeline execution
#
# 5. **Protect branches:**
#    - Settings → Repository → Protected branches

Solution: Use caching, split into fast/slow tests

# Issue 3: Flaky tests
Cause: Tests depend on random values, timing, or external services
Solution: Set random seeds, mock external calls, increase timeouts

# Issue 4: Merge conflicts in workflow files
Cause: Multiple people editing CI config
Solution: Keep workflow simple, use templates, communicate

# Issue 5: Secrets in logs
Cause: Printing environment variables
Solution: Use GitHub/GitLab secrets, mask sensitive data

# Issue 6: Coverage dropping
Cause: New code not tested

# ### Final Thoughts
#
# Remember our cautionary tale from Lecture 5?
#
# The climate research team's paper was retracted because:
# - ❌ No tests were written
# - ❌ No CI to run tests automatically
# - ❌ Bug went undetected for months
# - ❌ Results published without validation
#
# With what you learned in Lectures 5 and 6:
# - ✅ Tests would have caught the bug
# - ✅ CI would have prevented merging
# - ✅ Bug would never reach publication
# - ✅ Research would be trustworthy
#
# **Your research deserves better than to become a cautionary tale.**
#
# **Test your code. Automate your testing. Publish with confidence.**
